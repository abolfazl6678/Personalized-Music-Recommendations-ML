# Personalized-Music-Recommendations-ML
Unsupervised machine learning project clustering Rolling Stones songs from Spotify to uncover patterns in music features and support recommendation systems.

---

## Project Overview
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** to cluster songs from Spotify's Rolling Stones albums. By combining **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **clustering algorithms**, the goal is to uncover hidden patterns in song features and create **cohorts of similar songs**.  

Such cohorts can be used to improve **music recommendation systems**, helping streaming platforms deliver **personalized content** and enhance user engagement.  

---

## Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** on Spotify song dataset.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns.  
- Engineer meaningful features for clustering.  
- Apply **dimensionality reduction techniques** (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) for visualization.  
- Build **clustering models** (K-Means, Hierarchical, GMM).  
- Define **song cohorts** and analyze their characteristics.  
- Provide insights for **recommendation systems**.  

---

## Dataset
- Source: Spotify API (Rolling Stones albums dataset).  
- Each track includes metadata and audio features such as:  
  - **Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Loudness**  
  - **Speechiness, Valence, Tempo**  
  - **Popularity, Duration, Release Date, Album Info**  
- Each song has a unique **Spotify ID** and **URI**.  

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Inspection & Cleaning**  
   - Handle duplicates, missing values, validate unique song IDs
   - Visualize distribution of song features.
   - Check for outliers and handle them.
   - Remove significant outliers from the dataset and save the cleaned dataset

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering**  
   - Recommend albums and songs based on popularity
   - Examine correlations between song features, especially popularity.    
   - Analyze popularity trends over time.

3. **Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - Scale features for clustering.  
   - Dimension reduction and visualization. 

4. **Clustering Analysis**  
   - Determine optimal number of clusters uisng Elbow method
   - Apply clustering methods and compare their performance
   - Dataset split based on clustering results
---

## Expected Results
- Songs grouped into **cohorts with similar popularity profiles**.  
- Identification of **albums with the highest density of popular songs**.  
- Visualization of clusters in reduced feature space.

---

## Business Impact
- Helps streaming services (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music) improve **user engagement**.  
- Enables **personalized playlist generation**.  
- Provides insights for **music marketing strategies**.  
- Framework applicable to **any artist’s catalog or broader music dataset**.  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn 
- **Clustering**: K-Means, Hierarchical, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)   
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, t-SNE(t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook and Git/GitHub
